1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

            a, dup = 0, 0
            for c in s:
                dup |= a & (1 << (ord(c) - ord('a')))
                a |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))

                    continue
                dp.append(dp[i] | a)
                res = max(res, bin(dp[i] | a).count('1'))
