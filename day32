1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach


You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, h: List[int], b: int, l: int) -> int:
        p = []

        i = 0
        for i in range(len(h) -1):
            diff = h[i+1] - h[i]

            if diff <= 0:
                continue

            b -= diff
            x = heapq.heappush(p, -diff)
            print(x)
            if b < 0:
                b += -heapq.heappop(p)
                l -= 1

            if l < 0:
                return i
        return len(h)-1
